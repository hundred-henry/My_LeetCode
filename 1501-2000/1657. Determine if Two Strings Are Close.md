# other solution

Initialize Frequency Arrays:

Two arrays, temp1 and temp2, of size 26 are initialized to store the frequency of each character in the alphabet (assuming the strings only contain lowercase English letters).
Count Character Frequencies:

Two for loops iterate through each character in word1 and word2, respectively. In each iteration, the corresponding index in the temp1 and temp2 arrays is incremented based on the character's position in the alphabet.
Check for Same Characters:

The code then checks if the two strings have the same set of characters. It does so by iterating through the temp1 array and checking if, for each character position, either both strings have that character (both frequencies are greater than 0) or both strings do not have that character (both frequencies are equal to 0). If this condition is not met for any character position, the function returns false, indicating that the two strings are not close.
Sort Frequency Arrays:

The frequency arrays (temp1 and temp2) are then sorted using the sort function. This is done to compare the frequency distributions of characters in the next step.
Check Frequency Distributions:

The code compares each element of the sorted temp1 and temp2 arrays. If any corresponding elements are not equal, the flag variable is set to false, indicating that the frequency distributions are not the same.
Final Result:

The function returns flag, which is true if the two strings are close (i.e., they have the same set of characters and the same frequency distribution), and false otherwise.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:

    bool closeStrings(string word1, string word2) {

        vector<int>temp1(26);
        vector<int>temp2(26);
        bool flag = true;

        for(int i = 0; i < word1.size();i++){
            temp1[word1[i]-'a']++;
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < word2.size();i++){
            temp2[word2[i]-'a']++;
        }

        for(int i = 0; i < temp1.size();i++){
            if((temp1[i]>0 && temp2[i]==0) || (temp1[i]==0 && temp2[i]>0)){
                return false;
            }
        }

        sort(temp1.begin(),temp1.end());
        sort(temp2.begin(),temp2.end());

        for(int i = 0;i < 26;i++){
            if(temp1[i]!=temp2[i]){
                flag = false;
                break;
            }
        }

        return flag;
        
    }
};
