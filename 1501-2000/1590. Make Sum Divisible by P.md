Given an array of positive integers `nums`, remove the **smallest** subarray (possibly **empty**) such that the **sum** of the remaining elements is divisible by `p`. It is **not** allowed to remove the whole array.

Return *the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove, or* `-1` *if it's impossible*.

A **subarray** is defined as a contiguous block of elements in the array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1,4,2], p = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The sum of the elements in nums is 10, which is not divisible by 6. We can remove the subarray [4], and the sum of the remaining elements is 6, which is divisible by 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [6,3,5,2], p = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: We cannot remove a single element to get a sum divisible by 9. The best way is to remove the subarray [5,2], leaving us with [6,3] with sum 9.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], p = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: Here the sum is 6. which is already divisible by 3. Thus we do not need to remove anything.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `1 <= p <= 109`

# solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSubarray(int[] nums, int p) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int ans = Integer.MAX_VALUE, mod = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            mod = (mod + nums[i]) % p;
        }
        if (mod == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        map.put(0, -1);
        for (int i = 0, cur = 0, target; i < nums.length; i++) {
            cur = (cur + nums[i]) % p;
            target = (cur + p - mod) % p;
            if (map.containsKey(target)) {
                ans = Math.min(ans, i - map.get(target));
            }
            map.put(cur, i);
        }
        return ans == nums.length ? -1 : ans;
    }
}
```
