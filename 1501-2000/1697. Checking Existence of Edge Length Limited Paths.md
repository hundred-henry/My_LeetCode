An undirected graph of `n` nodes is defined by `edgeList`, where `edgeList[i] = [ui, vi, disi]` denotes an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` with distance `disi`. Note that there may be **multiple** edges between two nodes.

Given an array `queries`, where `queries[j] = [pj, qj, limitj]`, your task is to determine for each `queries[j]` whether there is a path between `pj` and `qj` such that each edge on the path has a distance **strictly less than** `limitj` .

Return *a **boolean array*** `answer`*, where* `answer.length == queries.length` *and the* `jth` *value of* `answer` *is* `true` *if there is a path for* `queries[j]` *is* `true`*, and* `false` *otherwise*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/08/h.png)

```
Input: n = 3, edgeList = [[0,1,2],[1,2,4],[2,0,8],[1,0,16]], queries = [[0,1,2],[0,2,5]]
Output: [false,true]
Explanation: The above figure shows the given graph. Note that there are two overlapping edges between 0 and 1 with distances 2 and 16.
For the first query, between 0 and 1 there is no path where each distance is less than 2, thus we return false for this query.
For the second query, there is a path (0 -> 1 -> 2) of two edges with distances less than 5, thus we return true for this query.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/08/q.png)

```
Input: n = 5, edgeList = [[0,1,10],[1,2,5],[2,3,9],[3,4,13]], queries = [[0,4,14],[1,4,13]]
Output: [true,false]
Explanation: The above figure shows the given graph.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `1 <= edgeList.length, queries.length <= 105`
- `edgeList[i].length == 3`
- `queries[j].length == 3`
- `0 <= ui, vi, pj, qj <= n - 1`
- `ui != vi`
- `pj != qj`
- `1 <= disi, limitj <= 109`
- There may be **multiple** edges between two nodes.
