There are `n` balls on a table, each ball has a color black or white.

You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `s` of length `n`, where `1` and `0` represent black and white balls, respectively.

In each step, you can choose two adjacent balls and swap them.

Return *the **minimum** number of steps to group all the black balls to the right and all the white balls to the left*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "101"
Output: 1
Explanation: We can group all the black balls to the right in the following way:
- Swap s[0] and s[1], s = "011".
Initially, 1s are not grouped together, requiring at least 1 step to group them to the right.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "100"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can group all the black balls to the right in the following way:
- Swap s[0] and s[1], s = "010".
- Swap s[1] and s[2], s = "001".
It can be proven that the minimum number of steps needed is 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "0111"
Output: 0
Explanation: All the black balls are already grouped to the right.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n == s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
