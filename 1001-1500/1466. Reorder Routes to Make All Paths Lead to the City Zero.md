There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by `connections` where `connections[i] = [ai, bi]` represents a road from city `ai` to city `bi`.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city `0`), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city `0`. Return the **minimum** number of edges changed.

It's **guaranteed** that each city can reach city `0` after reorder.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](D:\LeetCode\1001-1500\1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero.assets\sample_1_1819.png)

```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
```

**Example 2:**

![img](D:\LeetCode\1001-1500\1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero.assets\sample_2_1819.png)

```
Input: n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 5 * 104`
- `connections.length == n - 1`
- `connections[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
- `ai != bi`

                }
            }

        unordered_map<int,bool>vis;
        for(int i=0;i<s;i++){
            mp[c[i][1]].push_back(c[i][0]);
            mp[c[i][0]].push_back(-c[i][1]);
        }
        dfs(mp,vis,0);
        if(ans==0)return ans;
        return ans;
    }
