Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. A continuous subarray is called **nice** if there are `k` odd numbers on it.

Return *the number of **nice** sub-arrays*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,1,1], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The only sub-arrays with 3 odd numbers are [1,1,2,1] and [1,2,1,1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,4,6], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no odd numbers in the array.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,2], k = 2
Output: 16
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 50000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`

## Intuition

The problem requires counting the number of continuous subarrays with exactly `k` odd numbers. To achieve this, we can use a prefix sum approach. The key idea is to keep track of the number of odd numbers encountered so far while iterating through the array, and use this information to count subarrays with the desired property efficiently.

## Approach

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `n`: Length of the input array `nums`.
   - `cnt`: An array to keep track of the count of prefix sums (number of odd numbers encountered).
   - `cnt[0]`: Set to 1 initially, since a prefix sum of 0 (no odd numbers encountered) occurs once by default.
   - `ans`: Variable to store the final result (number of nice subarrays).
   - `t`: Variable to store the current count of odd numbers while iterating through the array.
2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - For each element `v` in `nums`, update the count of odd numbers (`t`) encountered so far. This is done by checking if `v` is odd using `v & 1`.
   - Check if there exists a prefix sum `t - k` (i.e., a previous state where there were `t - k` odd numbers). If so, add the count of such prefix sums to `ans`.
   - Increment the count of the current prefix sum (`t`) in the `cnt` array.
3. **Return the Result**:
   - After iterating through the entire array, `ans` will contain the number of nice subarrays.

class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSubarrays(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> cnt(n + 1, 0);
        cnt[0] = 1;
        int ans = 0, t = 0;
        for (int v : nums) {
            t += v & 1;
            if (t - k >= 0) {
                ans += cnt[t - k];
            }
            cnt[t]++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
