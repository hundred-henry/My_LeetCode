Given an `n x n` `grid` containing only values `0` and `1`, where `0` represents water and `1` represents land, find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized, and return the distance. If no land or water exists in the grid, return `-1`.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells `(x0, y0)` and `(x1, y1)` is `|x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/05/03/1336_ex1.JPG)

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The cell (1, 1) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 2.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/05/03/1336_ex2.JPG)

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The cell (2, 2) is as far as possible from all the land with distance 4.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`
