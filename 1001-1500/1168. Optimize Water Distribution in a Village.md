There are `n` houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.

For each house `i`, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost `wells[i - 1]` (note the `-1` due to **0-indexing**), or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array `pipes` where each `pipes[j] = [house1j, house2j, costj]` represents the cost to connect `house1j` and `house2j` together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional, and there could be multiple valid connections between the same two houses with different costs.

Return *the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/05/22/1359_ex1.png)

```
Input: n = 3, wells = [1,2,2], pipes = [[1,2,1],[2,3,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The image shows the costs of connecting houses using pipes.
The best strategy is to build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the total cost is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2, wells = [1,1], pipes = [[1,2,1],[1,2,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can supply water with cost two using one of the three options:
Option 1:
  - Build a well inside house 1 with cost 1.
  - Build a well inside house 2 with cost 1.
The total cost will be 2.
Option 2:
  - Build a well inside house 1 with cost 1.
  - Connect house 2 with house 1 with cost 1.
The total cost will be 2.
Option 3:
  - Build a well inside house 2 with cost 1.
  - Connect house 1 with house 2 with cost 1.
The total cost will be 2.
Note that we can connect houses 1 and 2 with cost 1 or with cost 2 but we will always choose the cheapest option. 
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 104`
- `wells.length == n`
- `0 <= wells[i] <= 105`
- `1 <= pipes.length <= 104`
- `pipes[j].length == 3`
- `1 <= house1j, house2j <= n`
- `0 <= costj <= 105`
- `house1j != house2j`
