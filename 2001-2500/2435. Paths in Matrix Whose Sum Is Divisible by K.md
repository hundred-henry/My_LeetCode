You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` integer matrix `grid` and an integer `k`. You are currently at position `(0, 0)` and you want to reach position `(m - 1, n - 1)` moving only **down** or **right**.

Return *the number of paths where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by* `k`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/08/13/image-20220813183124-1.png)

```
Input: grid = [[5,2,4],[3,0,5],[0,7,2]], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two paths where the sum of the elements on the path is divisible by k.
The first path highlighted in red has a sum of 5 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 18 which is divisible by 3.
The second path highlighted in blue has a sum of 5 + 3 + 0 + 5 + 2 = 15 which is divisible by 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/08/17/image-20220817112930-3.png)

```
Input: grid = [[0,0]], k = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: The path highlighted in red has a sum of 0 + 0 = 0 which is divisible by 5.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/08/12/image-20220812224605-3.png)

```
Input: grid = [[7,3,4,9],[2,3,6,2],[2,3,7,0]], k = 1
Output: 10
Explanation: Every integer is divisible by 1 so the sum of the elements on every possible path is divisible by k.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= m * n <= 5 * 104`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
- `1 <= k <= 50`

```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfPaths(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int mod = 1000000007;
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        int[][][] dp = new int[m][n][k];
        dp[m-1][n-1][grid[m-1][n-1] % k] = 1;
        for (int i=m-2, need; i>=0; i--) {
            for (int r=0; r<k; r++) {
                need = (k + r - grid[i][n-1] % k) % k;
                dp[i][n-1][r] = dp[i+1][n-1][need];
            }
        }

            for (int r=0; r<k; r++) {
                need = (k + r - grid[m-1][i] % k) % k;
                dp[m-1][i][r] = dp[m-1][i+1][need];
            }
        }

                for (int r=0, need; r<k; r++) {
                    need = (k + r - grid[i][j] % k) % k;
                    dp[i][j][r] = (dp[i+1][j][need] + dp[i][j+1][need]) % mod;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][0][0];
    }
