You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid` where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (occupied).

You are then given stamps of size `stampHeight x stampWidth`. We want to fit the stamps such that they follow the given **restrictions** and **requirements**:

1. Cover all the **empty** cells.
2. Do not cover any of the **occupied** cells.
3. We can put as **many** stamps as we want.
4. Stamps can **overlap** with each other.
5. Stamps are not allowed to be **rotated**.
6. Stamps must stay completely **inside** the grid.

Return `true` *if it is possible to fit the stamps while following the given restrictions and requirements. Otherwise, return* `false`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/03/ex1.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0]], stampHeight = 4, stampWidth = 3
Output: true
Explanation: We have two overlapping stamps (labeled 1 and 2 in the image) that are able to cover all the empty cells.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/03/ex2.png)

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,1]], stampHeight = 2, stampWidth = 2 
Output: false 
Explanation: There is no way to fit the stamps onto all the empty cells without the stamps going outside the grid.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[r].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 105`
- `1 <= m * n <= 2 * 105`
- `grid[r][c]` is either `0` or `1`.
- `1 <= stampHeight, stampWidth <= 105`
