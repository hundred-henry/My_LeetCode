You are given a 2D integer array `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [lefti, righti]` represents the **inclusive** interval `[lefti, righti]`.

You have to divide the intervals into one or more **groups** such that each interval is in **exactly** one group, and no two intervals that are in the same group **intersect** each other.

Return *the **minimum** number of groups you need to make*.

Two intervals **intersect** if there is at least one common number between them. For example, the intervals `[1, 5]` and `[5, 8]` intersect.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[5,10],[6,8],[1,5],[2,3],[1,10]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can divide the intervals into the following groups:
- Group 1: [1, 5], [6, 8].
- Group 2: [2, 3], [5, 10].
- Group 3: [1, 10].
It can be proven that it is not possible to divide the intervals into fewer than 3 groups.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[5,6],[8,10],[11,13]]
Output: 1
Explanation: None of the intervals overlap, so we can put all of them in one group.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= lefti <= righti <= 106`

## Intuition

We need to group intervals so that no intervals in the same group overlap. By sorting start and end times, we can track how many intervals overlap at any point. If a new interval starts after an earlier one ends, we can reuse that group. Otherwise, we need a new group.

## Approach

1. **Sort start and end times**: Sorting helps track when intervals start and end.
2. **Two pointers**:
   - `start_ptr` iterates through start times.
   - `end_ptr` tracks the earliest end time. If the current interval starts after the earliest end, reuse a group by incrementing `end_ptr`; otherwise, create a new group.
3. **Result**: The number of active groups after processing all intervals is the minimum number of groups required.

To avoid others getting stuck like I did on the question of why it's possible to sort the start time and end time separatelyâ€”doesn't their pairing matter? Here's my answer: no, it doesn't.

If we look at two intervals, say [2, 3] and [1, 5], and you draw them on a number line, you'll notice that it makes no difference if you swap them to [1, 3] and [2, 5], because they only overlap between [2, 3], while they're separate in the intervals [1, 2) and (3, 5].

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minGroups(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        vector<int> start_times, end_times;

        // Extract start and end times
        for (const auto& interval : intervals) {
            start_times.push_back(interval[0]);
            end_times.push_back(interval[1]);
        }

        // Sort start and end times
        sort(start_times.begin(), start_times.end());
        sort(end_times.begin(), end_times.end());

        int end_ptr = 0, group_count = 0;

        // Traverse through the start times
        for (int start : start_times) {
            if (start > end_times[end_ptr]) {
                end_ptr++;
            } else {
                group_count++;
            }
        }

        return group_count;
    }
};
```

# official solution

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int minGroups(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        // Convert the intervals to two events
        // start as {start, 1} and end as {end, -1}
        vector<pair<int, int>> intervalsWithEnd;
        for (vector<int> interval : intervals) {
            intervalsWithEnd.push_back({interval[0], 1});
            intervalsWithEnd.push_back({interval[1] + 1, -1});
        }

        // Sort the events according to the number and then by the value (1/-1).
        sort(intervalsWithEnd.begin(), intervalsWithEnd.end());

        int concurrentIntervals = 0;
        int maxConcurrentIntervals = 0;
        for (auto p : intervalsWithEnd) {
            // Keep track of currently active intersecting intervals.
            concurrentIntervals += p.second;
            // Update the maximum number of active intervals.
            maxConcurrentIntervals =
                max(maxConcurrentIntervals, concurrentIntervals);
        }

        return maxConcurrentIntervals;
    }
};
