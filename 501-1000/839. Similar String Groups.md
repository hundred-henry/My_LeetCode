Two strings, `X` and `Y`, are considered similar if either they are identical or we can make them equivalent by swapping at most two letters (in distinct positions) within the string `X`.

For example, `"tars"` and `"rats"` are similar (swapping at positions `0` and `2`), and `"rats"` and `"arts"` are similar, but `"star"` is not similar to `"tars"`, `"rats"`, or `"arts"`.

Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: `{"tars", "rats", "arts"}` and `{"star"}`. Notice that `"tars"` and `"arts"` are in the same group even though they are not similar. Formally, each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other word in the group.

We are given a list `strs` of strings where every string in `strs` is an anagram of every other string in `strs`. How many groups are there?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: strs = ["tars","rats","arts","star"]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: strs = ["omv","ovm"]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= strs.length <= 300`
- `1 <= strs[i].length <= 300`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase letters only.
- All words in `strs` have the same length and are anagrams of each other.
