There are `n` couples sitting in `2n` seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands.

The people and seats are represented by an integer array `row` where `row[i]` is the ID of the person sitting in the `ith` seat. The couples are numbered in order, the first couple being `(0, 1)`, the second couple being `(2, 3)`, and so on with the last couple being `(2n - 2, 2n - 1)`.

Return *the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side*. A swap consists of choosing any two people, then they stand up and switch seats.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: row = [0,2,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: We only need to swap the second (row[1]) and third (row[2]) person.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: row = [3,2,0,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: All couples are already seated side by side.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2n == row.length`
- `2 <= n <= 30`
- `n` is even.
- `0 <= row[i] < 2n`
- All the elements of `row` are **unique**.
