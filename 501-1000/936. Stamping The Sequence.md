You are given two strings `stamp` and `target`. Initially, there is a string `s` of length `target.length` with all `s[i] == '?'`.

In one turn, you can place `stamp` over `s` and replace every letter in the `s` with the corresponding letter from `stamp`.

- For example, if

   

  ```
  stamp = "abc"
  ```

   

  and

   

  ```
  target = "abcba"
  ```

  , then

   

  ```
  s
  ```

   

  is

   

  ```
  "?????"
  ```

   

  initially. In one turn you can:

  - place `stamp` at index `0` of `s` to obtain `"abc??"`,
  - place `stamp` at index `1` of `s` to obtain `"?abc?"`, or
  - place `stamp` at index `2` of `s` to obtain `"??abc"`.

  Note that

   

  ```
  stamp
  ```

   

  must be fully contained in the boundaries of

   

  ```
  s
  ```

   

  in order to stamp (i.e., you cannot place

   

  ```
  stamp
  ```

   

  at index

   

  ```
  3
  ```

   

  of

   

  ```
  s
  ```

  ).

We want to convert `s` to `target` using **at most** `10 * target.length` turns.

Return *an array of the index of the left-most letter being stamped at each turn*. If we cannot obtain `target` from `s` within `10 * target.length` turns, return an empty array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: stamp = "abc", target = "ababc"
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: Initially s = "?????".
- Place stamp at index 0 to get "abc??".
- Place stamp at index 2 to get "ababc".
[1,0,2] would also be accepted as an answer, as well as some other answers.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: stamp = "abca", target = "aabcaca"
Output: [3,0,1]
Explanation: Initially s = "???????".
- Place stamp at index 3 to get "???abca".
- Place stamp at index 0 to get "abcabca".
- Place stamp at index 1 to get "aabcaca".
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= stamp.length <= target.length <= 1000`
- `stamp` and `target` consist of lowercase English letters.
