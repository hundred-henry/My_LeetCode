In English, we have a concept called **root**, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word **derivative**. For example, when the **root** `"help"` is followed by the word `"ful"`, we can form a derivative `"helpful"`.

Given a `dictionary` consisting of many **roots** and a `sentence` consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the derivatives in the sentence with the **root** forming it. If a derivative can be replaced by more than one **root**, replace it with the **root** that has **the shortest length**.

Return *the `sentence`* after the replacement.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
Output: "the cat was rat by the bat"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: dictionary = ["a","b","c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"
Output: "a a b c"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= dictionary.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 100`
- `dictionary[i]` consists of only lower-case letters.
- `1 <= sentence.length <= 106`
- `sentence` consists of only lower-case letters and spaces.
- The number of words in `sentence` is in the range `[1, 1000]`
- The length of each word in `sentence` is in the range `[1, 1000]`
- Every two consecutive words in `sentence` will be separated by exactly one space.
- `sentence` does not have leading or trailing spaces.

# other solution

## Intuition

The goal of this problem is to replace words in a sentence with their corresponding roots from a given dictionary. The solution involves efficiently checking each word in the sentence to see if it starts with any of the roots in the dictionary. If a word starts with a root, it should be replaced with that root. To ensure that the solution is efficient and scalable, a Trie (prefix tree) data structure is used, which allows for fast prefix search operations.

## Approach

1. **Trie Construction:**
   - First, we create a Trie data structure to store all the roots from the dictionary. Each node in the Trie represents a character, and nodes are linked to form paths representing the roots.
   - We insert each root into the Trie. During insertion, if a character is not already a child of the current node, a new Trie node is created.
2. **Sentence Processing:**
   - Split the sentence into individual words.
   - For each word, search the Trie to find the shortest prefix that matches any root in the Trie.
   - If a matching prefix is found, replace the word with this prefix. If no matching prefix is found, retain the original word.
   - Reconstruct the sentence from the processed words.
3. **Trie Search:**
   - To search for the shortest prefix, traverse the Trie character by character.
   - If a node is marked as the end of a root during traversal, return the prefix up to that node.
   - If traversal ends without finding any root, return the original word.

## Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - **Trie Construction:** Inserting each root into the Trie takes O(L), where L is the length of the root. For N roots, this results in O(NL) time.
  - **Sentence Processing:** For each word in the sentence, the Trie is traversed character by character, taking O(L') time per word, where L' is the length of the word. For M words in the sentence, this results in O(M * L') time.
  - Overall, the time complexity is O(NL + M * L'), where N is the number of roots, L is the average length of the roots, M is the number of words in the sentence, and L' is the average length of the words.
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is O(26 * NL) for storing the Trie nodes, where each node can have up to 26 children (one for each lowercase letter).
  - Additionally, storing the input sentence and the resulting sentence takes O(M * L') space.
  - Overall, the space complexity is O(NL + M * L').

```C++
class Trie {
public:
    Trie* children[26];
    bool isEnd;

    Trie() {
        for (int i=0; i<26; i++) {
            children[i] = nullptr;
        }
        isEnd = false;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    Trie* root;
    
    Solution() {
        root = new Trie();
    }

    void insert(string word) {
        Trie* node = root;
        for (char c: word) {
            int index = c - 'a';
            if (node->children[index] == nullptr) {
                node->children[index] = new Trie();
            }
            node = node->children[index];
        }
        node->isEnd = true;
    }

    string search(string word) {
        Trie* node = root;
        string result;
        for (char c: word) {
            int index = c - 'a';
            if (node->children[index] == nullptr) {
                return word;
            }
            result += c;
            if (node->children[index]->isEnd) {
                return result;
            }
            node = node->children[index];
        }
        return word;
    }

    string replaceWords(vector<string>& dictionary, string sentence) {
        for (string word: dictionary) {
            insert(word);
        }

        stringstream ss(sentence);
        string word, result;
        while (ss >> word) {
            if (!result.empty()) {
                result += " ";
            }
            result += search(word);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
