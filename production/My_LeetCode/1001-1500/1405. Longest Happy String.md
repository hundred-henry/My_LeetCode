A string `s` is called **happy** if it satisfies the following conditions:

- `s` only contains the letters `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`.
- `s` does not contain any of `"aaa"`, `"bbb"`, or `"ccc"` as a substring.
- `s` contains **at most** `a` occurrences of the letter `'a'`.
- `s` contains **at most** `b` occurrences of the letter `'b'`.
- `s` contains **at most** `c` occurrences of the letter `'c'`.

Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, return *the **longest possible happy** string*. If there are multiple longest happy strings, return *any of them*. If there is no such string, return *the empty string* `""`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = 1, b = 1, c = 7
Output: "ccaccbcc"
Explanation: "ccbccacc" would also be a correct answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = 7, b = 1, c = 0
Output: "aabaa"
Explanation: It is the only correct answer in this case.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= a, b, c <= 100`
- `a + b + c > 0`
