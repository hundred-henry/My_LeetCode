You have `n` jobs and `m` workers. You are given three arrays: `difficulty`, `profit`, and `worker` where:

- `difficulty[i]` and `profit[i]` are the difficulty and the profit of the `ith` job, and
- `worker[j]` is the ability of `jth` worker (i.e., the `jth` worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most `worker[j]`).

Every worker can be assigned **at most one job**, but one job can be **completed multiple times**.

- For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays `$1`, then the total profit will be `$3`. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is `$0`.

Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
Output: 100
Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: difficulty = [85,47,57], profit = [24,66,99], worker = [40,25,25]
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == difficulty.length`
- `n == profit.length`
- `m == worker.length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 104`
- `1 <= difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i] <= 105`

                    start = mid + 1;

## Intuition

The problem requires assigning the most profitable jobs to workers based on their ability to handle the job difficulty. Each worker can complete only one job, and each job can be completed multiple times by different workers. To maximize the total profit, we need to ensure that each worker is assigned the most profitable job they can complete given their skill level.

## Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Determine the maximum job difficulty.
   - Initialize a `maxProfitUpToDifficulty` array to store the maximum profit for each difficulty level up to the maximum difficulty.
2. **Fill the Profit Lookup Table**:
   - For each job, update the `maxProfitUpToDifficulty` array to ensure it holds the maximum profit for the given difficulty.
   - Convert the `maxProfitUpToDifficulty` array to a cumulative maximum profit array, where each index `i` will have the maximum profit possible for difficulties from `0` to `i`.
3. **Calculate Total Profit**:
   - For each worker, use their ability to look up the corresponding maximum profit from the `maxProfitUpToDifficulty` array and sum up the total profit.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfitAssignment(vector<int>& difficulty, vector<int>& profit, vector<int>& worker) {
        int maxDifficulty = *max_element(difficulty.begin(), difficulty.end());
        vector<int> maxProfitUpToDifficulty(maxDifficulty + 1, 0);

        for (int i = 0; i < difficulty.size(); ++i) {
            maxProfitUpToDifficulty[difficulty[i]] = max(maxProfitUpToDifficulty[difficulty[i]], profit[i]);
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= maxDifficulty; ++i) {
            maxProfitUpToDifficulty[i] = max(maxProfitUpToDifficulty[i], maxProfitUpToDifficulty[i - 1]);
        }

        int totalProfit = 0;
        for (int ability : worker) {
            if (ability > maxDifficulty) {
                totalProfit += maxProfitUpToDifficulty[maxDifficulty];
            } else {
                totalProfit += maxProfitUpToDifficulty[ability];
            }
        }

        return totalProfit;
    }
};
