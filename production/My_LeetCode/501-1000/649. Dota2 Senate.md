In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire.

The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the Senate wants to decide on a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each senator can exercise **one** of the two rights:

- **Ban one senator's right:** A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.
- **Announce the victory:** If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and decide on the change in the game.

Given a string `senate` representing each senator's party belonging. The character `'R'` and `'D'` represent the Radiant party and the Dire party. Then if there are `n` senators, the size of the given string will be `n`.

The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.

Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party. Predict which party will finally announce the victory and change the Dota2 game. The output should be `"Radiant"` or `"Dire"`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: senate = "RD"
Output: "Radiant"
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
And in round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: senate = "RDD"
Output: "Dire"
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
And the third senator comes from Dire and he can ban the first senator's right in round 1. 
And in round 2, the third senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == senate.length`
- `1 <= n <= 104`
- `senate[i]` is either `'R'` or `'D'`.

            }

            if (senate.find('R') == string::npos){

            if (senate.find('D') == string::npos){

            }
        }
    }

# Idea

- **We will use a two queue approach.**
- Recall, each senator has a position to exercise their right.
- The ones to the left have an earlier turn than the ones to the right.
- `rad` is queue that holds all positions of **active** senators in "Radiant"
- `dir` is queue that holds all positions of **active** senators in "Dire".
- **Active** being that they still have the right to vote.
- Our queue will be ordered so that the senators with earlier voting power come first (to the left of the queue).
- To goal is to have the earliest senator of each queue *fight* each other to see who gets to eliminate the other depending on their position.
- Obviously, the one with the earlier position will win.
- The loser is removed from the queue since they are no longer **active.**
- The winner will go to the end of the queue for the next round.
- We keep doing this until one queue is empty which means there are no more senators on the team.

# Everything is easier with an example:

- `senate = "RDDDRDRRDR"`

    string predictPartyVictory(string senate) {
        queue<int> rad, dir;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if (senate[i] == 'R'){
                rad.push(i);
            }

            else {
                dir.push(n++);
            }
            rad.pop(), dir.pop();
        }
        return (rad.empty()) ? ("Dire") : ("Radiant");
    }
};
```

### Why does the winner go to the end of the queue?

- Since the voting is done such that both sides perform the most optimal strategy, the senators who have already voted will not be a problem to the other team for that round.
- So, instead of eliminating a senator who has already moved, the best move for each team is to eliminate the next senator who has the power to vote.
- This works perfectly with the queue approach since we can just place the senators who have voted at the end.
