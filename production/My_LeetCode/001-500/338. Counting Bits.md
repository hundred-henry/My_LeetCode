Given an integer `n`, return *an array* `ans` *of length* `n + 1` *such that for each* `i` (`0 <= i <= n`)*,* `ans[i]` *is the **number of*** `1`***'s** in the binary representation of* `i`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n <= 105`

 

**Follow up:**

- It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of `O(n log n)`. Can you do it in linear time `O(n)` and possibly in a single pass?
- Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like `__builtin_popcount` in C++)?

# my solution

runtime: 100.00%

memory: 8.80%

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int n) {
        vector<int> ans;
        for (int i=0; i<n+1; i++) {
            int count = 0, i_copy = i;
            while (i_copy > 0) {
                int temp = i_copy;
                i_copy = i_copy >> 1;
                count += temp - (i_copy<<1);
            }
            ans.push_back(count);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Tabulation solution.

- by tracing the sequence
  - 0 -> 000000000
  - 1 -> 000000001
  - 2 -> 000000010
  - 3 -> 2 + 1 -> 000000011
  - 4 -> 000000100
  - 5 -> 4 + 1 -> 000000101
  - 6 -> 4 + 2 -> 000000110
  - 7 -> 4 + 3 -> 000000111
  - 8 -> 8 -> 000001000
  - 9 -> 8 + 1 -> 000001001
  - 10 -> 8 + 2 -> 000001010
  - 11 -> 8 + 3 -> 000001011
  - 12 -> 8 + 4 -> 000001100
- So from that we can conclude that we can use the previously computed results, and just increment what we got previously to compute the new results.
- and we should set v[2^i] = 1 = v[2] = v[4] = v[8] ....

- so.

1. base cases for this is when
   1. i = 0 return {0}
   2. i = 1 return {0,1}
   3. i = 2 return {0,1,1}
2. create a vector of size n + 1.
3. insert seeds.
   1. v[0] = 0.
   2. v[1] = 1.
   3. v[2] = 1.
4. we need to keep tracking of the last power of 2 and the next power of 2.
5. so initialize a power variable with value = 2.
6. the first power we have is 2^1, and we should start from 1 again when i = 2^ power + 1, which is 2^2 here, so we should define **nextStop** at 2^power.
7. and this power value will get incremented at each station of 2^x, so when i == 4 we should increment it, and same when i == 8, == 16 and so on...
8. then we need to iterate from 3 to n + 1.
   1. if i == nextStop (2 ^ x)
      1. we should set v[i] = 1
      2. the previousPower should be equal to the previous stop
      3. then we need to increment the previous power by one.
      4. then set the next stop to 2^power.
   2. else
      1. the current value = v[lastPower] + v[i - lastPower]
      2. ie: v[3] = v[2] + v[1]
      3. ie: v[10] = v[8] + v[10 - 8]
      4. ie: v[17] = v[16] + v[17 - 16] and so on.
9. now we are finished, so just return the vector v.

        /// base cases (all the seeds are base cases).
        if(n == 0) 
            return {0}; 
        if (n == 1)
            return {0,1};
        if (n == 2)
            return {0,1,1};
        vector<int> v(n + 1);
        int power = 2;
        v[0] = 0;
        v[1] = v[2] = 1;
        long powersOfTwo = pow(2, power - 1);
        double nextStop = pow(2, power);
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++)
            if (i == nextStop) {
                v[i] = 1;
                powersOfTwo = nextStop;
                nextStop = pow(2, ++power);
            }
            else
                v[i] = v[powersOfTwo] + v[i - powersOfTwo];

        return v;
    } 
    //! using the built in method
    vector<int> countBitsUsingBuiltInFunction(int n) {
            DPSolver;
            
            vector<int> v(n + 1);
            //! using built in function which counts the number of set bits.
            for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++)
                v[i] = __builtin_popcount(i);
            return v;
        }

    
};
