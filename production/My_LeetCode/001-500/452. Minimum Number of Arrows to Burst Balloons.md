There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return *the **minimum** number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= points.length <= 105`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `-231 <= xstart < xend <= 231 - 1`

                prev = point;
            }

    }

## Intuition

**Find the maximum and the minimum range in which we can burst maximum ballons as we have to use minimum arrows.**

## Approach

- **"ind"** is set to 1, representing the index to iterate through the sorted array of balloons.
- **"min_range"** and **"max_range"** are initialized with the xstart and xend values of the first balloon respectively, assuming the first balloon as the initial range.
- "**no_of_arrows**" is initialized to 1, as at least one arrow is required to start the process.

**1. Inside the loop, it checks if the xstart of the current balloon is less than or equal to the max_range. If it is, it means the current balloon overlaps with the range covered by the previous arrow. In this case:**

- min_range is updated to the maximum of the current xstart and the existing min_range.
- max_range is updated to the minimum of the current xend and the existing max_range.

**2. If the current balloon does not overlap with the previous range (i.e., p\[ind\]\[0\] > max_range), it means a new arrow is required. In this case:**

- no_of_arrows is incremented to signify the need for another arrow.
- min_range and max_range are updated with the xstart and xend values of the current balloon.
- ind is incremented to move to the next balloon.

## Complexity

- Time complexity:
  **O(N)**
- Space complexity:
  **O(1)**

## Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findMinArrowShots(vector<vector<int>>& p) {
        
        sort(begin(p) , end(p));

        int ind = 1;
        int min_range = p[0][0];
        int max_range = p[0][1];
        int no_of_arrows = 1;
        int n = p.size();

        while(ind < n){
            if(p[ind][0] <= max_range){
                min_range = max(min_range , p[ind][0]);
                max_range = min(max_range , p[ind][1]);
                ind++;
            }
            else{
                no_of_arrows++;
                min_range = p[ind][0];
                max_range = p[ind][1];
                ind++;
            }
        }
        return no_of_arrows;
    }
};
