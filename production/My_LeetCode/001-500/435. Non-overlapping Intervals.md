Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return *the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104`

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](const vector<int>& a,  const vector<int>& b) {  
            return a[1] < b[1];  
        });
        int ans = 0;
        vector<int> prev = intervals[0];
        for (vector<int>& i: intervals) {
            if (i[0] < prev[1]) ans++;
            else prev = i;
        }
        return ans-1;  // intervals[0]
    }
};
```

#### Initial Steps

- Sort the given intervals based on starting points
- While considering the intervals in the ascending order of starting points
  - we make use of a pointer prev pointer
  - to keep track of the interval just included in the final list

#### Case 1

- You don't need to remove any intervals
- Continue by simply assigning the *prev* pointer to the later interval
- The count of intervals removed remains unchanged

#### Case 2

- Remove the interval with the later end point
- The *prev* pointer is updated to current interval
- count of intervals removed is incremented by 1

#### Case 3

- Remove the interval with the later end point
- The *prev* pointer remains unchanged
- count of intervals removed is incremented by 1

#### Rule of Thumb

- Always choose the interval that ends first
