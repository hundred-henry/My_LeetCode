There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return *the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == ratings.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
- `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104`

            if (ratings[i-1] > ratings[i] && candyArr[i-1] <= candyArr[i]) candyArr[i-1] = candyArr[i] + 1;

## One-Pass Greedy Algorithm: Up-Down-Peak Method

### Why `Up`, `Down`, and `Peak`?

The essence of the one-pass greedy algorithm lies in these three variables: `Up`, `Down`, and `Peak`. They serve as counters for the following:

- **`Up`:** Counts how many children have **increasing ratings** from the last child. This helps us determine how many candies we need for a child with a higher rating than the previous child.
- **`Down`:** Counts how many children have **decreasing ratings** from the last child. This helps us determine how many candies we need for a child with a lower rating than the previous child.
- **`Peak`:** Keeps track of the **last highest point** in an increasing sequence. When we have a decreasing sequence after the peak, we can refer back to the `Peak` to adjust the number of candies if needed.

### How Does it Work?

1. Initialize Your Counters
   - Start with `ret = 1` because each child must have at least one candy. Initialize `up`, `down`, and `peak` to 0.
2. Loop Through Ratings
   - For each pair of adjacent children, compare their ratings. Here are the scenarios:
     - **If the rating is increasing**: Update `up` and `peak` by incrementing them by 1. Set `down` to 0. Add `up + 1` to `ret` because the current child must have one more candy than the previous child.
     - **If the rating is the same**: Reset `up`, `down`, and `peak` to 0, because neither an increasing nor a decreasing trend is maintained. Add 1 to `ret` because the current child must have at least one candy.
     - **If the rating is decreasing**: Update `down` by incrementing it by 1. Reset `up` to 0. Add `down` to `ret`. Additionally, if `peak` is greater than or equal to `down`, decrement `ret` by 1. This is because the peak child can share the same number of candies as one of the children in the decreasing sequence, which allows us to reduce the total number of candies.
3. Return the Total Candy Count
   - At the end of the loop, `ret` will contain the minimum total number of candies needed for all the children, so return `ret`.

By using `up`, `down`, and `peak`, we can efficiently traverse the ratings list just once, updating our total candies count (`ret`) as we go. This method is efficient and helps us solve the problem in a single pass, with a time complexity of O(n)O(n)*O*(*n*).

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$, for the single pass through the ratings array.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$ as we only use a few extra variables.

```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        if not ratings:
            return 0
        
        ret, up, down, peak = 1, 0, 0, 0
        
        for prev, curr in zip(ratings[:-1], ratings[1:]):
            if prev < curr:
                up, down, peak = up + 1, 0, up + 1
                ret += 1 + up
            elif prev == curr:
                up = down = peak = 0
                ret += 1
            else:
                up, down = 0, down + 1
                ret += 1 + down - int(peak >= down)
        
        return ret
```
