Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return *the researcher's h-index*.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == citations.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

        map<int, int> count;
        int n = citations.size();
        for (int& citation: citations) {

            it->second += ans;
            ans = it->second;
        }
        ans = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if (min(count[citations[i]], citations[i]) > ans)
                ans = min(count[citations[i]], citations[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }

## Binary Search

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        sort(citations.begin() , citations.end());
        int l = 0 , h = citations.size()-1;
        int n = citations.size();
        int ans = 0; 
        while(l <= h){
            int mid  = l +(h-l)/2;
            int idx = n  - mid ;
            if(citations[mid] >= idx){
                ans = idx;
                h = mid-1; 
            }
            else{
                l = mid +1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

## Count Sorting

```java
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(citations)
        temp = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]

        for i,v in enumerate(citations):
            if v > n :
                temp[n] += 1
            else:
                temp[v] += 1
        
        total = 0
        for i in range(n, -1, -1):
            total += temp[i]
            if total >= i:
                return i
