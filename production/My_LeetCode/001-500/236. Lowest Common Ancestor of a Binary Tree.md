Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

 

**Example 1:**

![img](D:\LeetCode\001-500\236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree.assets\binarytree.png)

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](D:\LeetCode\001-500\236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree.assets\binarytree.png)

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 105]`.
- `-109 <= Node.val <= 109`
- All `Node.val` are **unique**.
- `p != q`
- `p` and `q` will exist in the tree.



# other solution

Same solution in several languages. It's recursive and expands the meaning of the function. If the current (sub)tree contains both p and q, then the function result is their LCA. If only one of them is in that subtree, then the result is that one of them. If neither are in that subtree, the result is null/None/nil.

Update: I also wrote [two iterative solutions](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/discuss/65245/Iterative-Solutions-in-PythonC%2B%2B) now, one of them being a version of the solution here. They're more complicated than this simple recursive solution, but I do find them interesting.

```C++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (root==nullptr || root==p || root==q) return root;
        TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);

        if (left==nullptr && right==nullptr) return nullptr;
        else if (left!=nullptr && right==nullptr) return left;
        else if (left==nullptr && right!=nullptr) return right;
        else return root;
    }
};
```
