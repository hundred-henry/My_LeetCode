You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

# solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        return Math.max(f(nums, 1, nums.length-1), nums[0] + f(nums, 2, nums.length-2));
    }

    public static int f(int[] nums, int l, int r) {
        if (l > r) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (l == r) {
            return nums[l];
        }
        if (l + 1 == r) {
            return Math.max(nums[l], nums[r]);
        }

        int prepre = nums[l], pre = Math.max(nums[l], nums[l+1]);
        for (int i=l+2, cur; i<=r; i++) {
            cur = Math.max(prepre + nums[i], pre);
            prepre = pre;
            pre = cur;
        }
        return pre;
    }
}
```
