# Approach

We can use two variables, first_small and second_small, to keep track of the two smallest elements encountered so far. We initialize them with the maximum possible integer value initially. Then, we iterate through the array nums.

- If the current element nums[i] is less than or equal to first_small, we update first_small with nums[i].
- If nums[i] is greater than first_small but less than or equal to second_small, we update second_small with nums[i].
- If nums[i] is greater than both first_small and second_small, we have found an increasing triplet, and we return true.
- If we finish iterating through the array without finding an increasing triplet, we return false.

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool increasingTriplet(vector<int>& nums) {
        int num1=INT_MAX, num2=INT_MAX;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++){
            if (nums[i] <= num1){
                num1 = nums[i];
            }
            else if (nums[i] <= num2){
                num2 = nums[i];
            }
            else {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
