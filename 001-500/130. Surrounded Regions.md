You are given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing **letters** `'X'` and `'O'`, **capture regions** that are **surrounded**:

- **Connect**: A cell is connected to adjacent cells horizontally or vertically.
- **Region**: To form a region **connect every** `'O'` cell.
- **Surround**: The region is surrounded with `'X'` cells if you can **connect the region** with `'X'` cells and none of the region cells are on the edge of the `board`.

To capture a **surrounded region**, replace all `'O'`s with `'X'`s **in-place** within the original board. You do not need to return anything.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

**Output:** [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]

**Explanation:**

In the above diagram, the bottom region is not captured because it is on the edge of the board and cannot be surrounded.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board = [["X"]]

**Output:** [["X"]]

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.

```java
class Solution {
    public static int m, n;
    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        m = board.length;
        n = board[0].length;
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if (board[0][i] == 'O') {
                dfs(0, i, board);
            }
            if (board[m-1][i] == 'O') {
                dfs(m-1, i, board);
