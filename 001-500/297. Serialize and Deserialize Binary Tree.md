Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://support.leetcode.com/hc/en-us/articles/32442719377939-How-to-create-test-cases-on-LeetCode#h_01J5EGREAW3NAEJ14XC07GRW1A). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](./297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree.assets/serdeser.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
public class Codec {

    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    public String serialize(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return("#,");
        }
        StringBuilder ans = new StringBuilder();
        ans.append(root.val+",");
        ans.append(serialize(root.left));
        ans.append(serialize(root.right));
        return ans.toString();
    }

    public static int cnt;
    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {
        String[] vals = data.split(",");
        cnt = 0;
        return dec(vals);
    }

    public TreeNode dec(String[] vals) {
        String cur = vals[cnt++];
        if (cur.equals("#")) {
            return null;
        } else {
            TreeNode head = new TreeNode(Integer.valueOf(cur));
            head.left = dec(vals);
            head.right = dec(vals);
            return head;
        }
    }
}

// Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
// Codec ser = new Codec();
// Codec deser = new Codec();
// TreeNode ans = deser.deserialize(ser.serialize(root));
```
