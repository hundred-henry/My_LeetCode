An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

Given an integer `n`, return *the* `nth` ***ugly number***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1690`

# solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
        int[] dp = new int[n+1];
        dp[1] = 1;
        for (int i=2, i2=1, i3=1, i5=1, a, b, c, cur; i<=n; i++) {
            a = dp[i2] * 2;
            b = dp[i3] * 3;
            c = dp[i5] * 5;
            cur = Math.min(a, Math.min(b, c));
            if (cur == a) {
                i2++;
            }
            if (cur == b) {
                i3++;
            } 
            if (cur == c) {
                i5++;
            }
            dp[i] = cur;
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
