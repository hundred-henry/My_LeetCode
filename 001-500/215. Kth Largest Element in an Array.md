Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the* `kth` *largest element in the array*.

Note that it is the `kth` largest element in the sorted order, not the `kth` distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

public:
    int findKthLargest(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        priority_queue<int> pq;
        for (int num: nums) pq.push(num);
        for (int i=0; i<k-1; i++) pq.pop();
        return pq.top();
    }

## Approach 2/3: Min-Heap

The main idea of this solution is to use a min-heap with a maximum size of `k`. By doing this, we ensure that the smallest of the `k` largest elements is always on the top of the heap.

### Key Data Structures:

- **`heap`**:
  This is a min-heap containing the first `k` elements of `nums`. As we progress, we will modify this heap to ensure it contains the `k` largest elements.

### Step-by-step Breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:

   - Create a heap with the first `k` elements of `nums`.
   - Transform this list into a min-heap.

2. **Iterate through the List**:

   - For each of the remaining elements in

      

     ```
     nums
     ```

     :

     - If the element is larger than the smallest element in the heap (i.e., the top of the heap):
       - Remove the top element from the heap.
       - Insert the current element into the heap.

3. **Result**:

   - After processing all elements in `nums`, the top of the heap will contain the `k`th largest element. Return this element.

### Example:

Consider the list `nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4]` with `k = 2`.

Here's the evolution of the `heap`:

**Initial State**:

- `heap`: [3,2]

**After processing index 2 (element = 1)**:

- `heap` remains unchanged as `1` is not larger than `2`.

**After processing index 3 (element = 5)**:

- `heap`: [3,5]

**After processing index 4 (element = 6)**:

- `heap`: [5,6]

**After processing index 5 (element = 4)**:

- `heap`: [5,6]

The final state of the `heap` shows that the `k`th largest element is `5`.

### Complexity

**Time Complexity:** $O(nlog⁡k)$
Each of the `n` elements is processed once. However, heap operations take $O(logk)$ time, leading to an overall complexity of $O(nlog⁡k)$

**Space Complexity:** $O(k)$
The solution uses a heap with a maximum of `k` elements.

### Performance

This solution is both time and space-efficient. By focusing only on the `k` largest elements and using the properties of a heap, it ensures optimal runtime for a wide range of inputs. The controlled space usage ensures that even for large `k`, the memory overhead remains minimal.
