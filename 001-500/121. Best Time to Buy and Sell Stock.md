You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`

            if (minPrice > prices[i]) {
                minPrice = prices[i];
            }
            if (prices[i] - minPrice > ans) {
                ans = prices[i] - minPrice;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

## Relating with the Approach

In the provided approach for finding the maximum profit in stock prices, the algorithm can be seen as a variation of Kadane's Algorithm. Instead of finding the maximum subarray sum directly, it focuses on finding the maximum positive difference between consecutive elements (prices) in the array.

Here's how the approach relates to Kadane's Algorithm:

1. **Initialization:**
   - In Kadane's Algorithm, `max_current` and `max_global` are initialized to the first element of the array.
   - In the stock profit approach, `buy` is initialized with the first element of the prices array, and `profit` is initialized to 0.
2. **Iteration:**
   - Kadane's Algorithm iterates through the array, updating `max_current` based on the current element's value and deciding whether to start a new subarray.
   - The stock profit approach iterates through the prices array, updating `buy` when a lower price is encountered and treating the difference between the current price and `buy` as a potential profit.
3. **Comparison and Update:**
   - Kadane's Algorithm compares and updates `max_current` and `max_global` at each iteration.
   - The stock profit approach compares and updates `profit` whenever a positive difference between the current price and `buy` exceeds the current profit.

## Complexity

- Time complexity: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the prices array. The algorithm iterates through the array once.
- Space complexity: $O(1)$ as only a constant amount of extra space is used.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(std::vector<int>& prices) {
        int buy = prices[0];
        int profit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (prices[i] < buy) {
                buy = prices[i];
            } else if (prices[i] - buy > profit) {
                profit = prices[i] - buy;
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
};
```
