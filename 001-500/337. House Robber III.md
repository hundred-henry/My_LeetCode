The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called `root`.

Besides the `root`, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if **two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given the `root` of the binary tree, return *the maximum amount of money the thief can rob **without alerting the police***.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](./337. House Robber III.assets/rob1-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](./337. House Robber III.assets/rob2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 104`
