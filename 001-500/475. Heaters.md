Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.

Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range. 

Given the positions of `houses` and `heaters` on a horizontal line, return *the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses.*

**Notice** that all the `heaters` follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: houses = [1,2,3], heaters = [2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: houses = [1,2,3,4], heaters = [1,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The two heaters were placed at positions 1 and 4. We need to use a radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: houses = [1,5], heaters = [2]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= houses.length, heaters.length <= 3 * 104`
- `1 <= houses[i], heaters[i] <= 109`

# solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int findRadius(int[] houses, int[] heaters) {
        Arrays.sort(houses);
        Arrays.sort(heaters);
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i=0, j=0; i<houses.length; i++) {
            while (!best(houses, heaters, i, j)) {
                j++;
            }
            ans = Math.max(ans, Math.abs(houses[i] - heaters[j]));
        }
        return ans;
    }

    public static boolean best(int[] houses, int[] heaters, int i, int j) {
        return j == (heaters.length - 1) 
        || Math.abs(heaters[j] - houses[i]) < Math.abs(heaters[j+1] - houses[i]);
    }
}
```
